# Amina Smakar Website

A website made for my friend Amina who is running a catering company.

## About

Amina wanted a website where people could see her work and they could contact her for job inquiries. It is under development.

## Goal and requirements

I wanted to make a website that was clean and easy to navigate through. I made the website responsive because most people use their phones nowadays. It is a one-page with different categories so you can scroll through the whole site.

## Key learnings

- React.js

- Hosting a website with FileZilla
